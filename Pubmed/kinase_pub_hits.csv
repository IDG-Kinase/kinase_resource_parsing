Interestingly, cancer cells take full advantage of autophagy both to support tumor growth in adverse microenvironments and to oppose damages induced by anti-neoplastic therapies. Importantly, different human oncogenes are able to modulate this survival mechanism to support the transformation process, u",2018,10,05,Autophagy,Autophagy,Leonardi,Margherita,"a Istituto per lo Studio, la Prevenzione e la Rete Oncologica (ISPRO) , Siena , Italy",NA,AAK1,https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2018.1517855

It is caused by mutations in the WNK1, WNK4, KLHL3 or CUL3 gene. There is strong evidence that excessive sodium chloride reabsorption by the sodium chloride cotransporter NCC in the distal convoluted tubule is involved. WNK4 is expressed not only in distal convoluted tubule cells but also",2018,08,27,Kidney Int.,Kidney international,López-Cayuqueo,Karen I,"Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale, Unité Mixte de Recherche 970, Paris, France",NA,WNK4,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.kint.2018.05.001

While neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy responses were variable in LARC patients, so, it is important to identify genes that closely associated with short-term and long-term responses to radiotherapy. In this study, we profiled long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) expression values of LARC patients with different neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy downstaging depth score based on A",2018,10,15,J.

However, molecular mechanism in the progression of myocardial I/R injury is still unclear. The goal of this study was to investigate the expression and function of microRNA-140 (miR-140) in the process of myocardial I/R injury.

Although the direct targets of PD-1 were not identified, its inhibitory action on the TCR signaling pathway was known much earlier.
