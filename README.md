# Kinase Resource Parsing

This repository holds a collection of the miscelleous code I've written to process, parse or filter various large scale databases down to just the kinases. Each folder only deals with a specific resource for the most part and nearly all the code is written in R.

Hopefully, the various scripts here can provide a starting point for parsing these databases for other projects as well.
